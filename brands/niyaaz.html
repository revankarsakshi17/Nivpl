            <h2>Niyaaz</h2>

            <p>
                Niyaaz is the heart of our culinary story—the flagship brand that gave shape
                and soul to everything NIVPL stands for today. What began as a humble restaurant
                in Belagavi has grown into a name synonymous with authenticity, trust, and
                timeless flavour.
            </p>

            <p>
                Born from a simple passion for good food, Niyaaz set out to serve dishes that
                carried the warmth of home and the richness of tradition. Every recipe was
                crafted with care, every meal prepared with honesty—creating flavours that
                became part of Belagavi’s food culture.
            </p>

            <p>
                From our signature biryanis to a wide range of Indian and regional favourites,
                Niyaaz stands for consistency, quality, and taste that never fades. It’s not
                just a place to eat—it’s where families celebrate, friends connect, and
                memories are made over food that feels familiar yet special every single time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through years of dedication, Niyaaz has grown beyond being a restaurant—it has
                become a tradition cherished by generations who trust us for the experience
                they first fell in love with.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Niyaaz, every plate tells a story of passion, perseverance, 
                and the joy of serving food that brings people together.
