            <p>

                region’s most respected names in hospitality. N I Ventures Private Limited (NIVPL)
                stands as the corporate home to the Niyaaz Group of Restaurants — a collection of

            </p>

            <p>
                From that first kitchen on P.B. Road, NIVPL has grown into a multi-brand enterprise
                that spans dine-in, delivery, and takeaway concepts. Yet, the essence remains
                unchanged — creating food experiences that bring people together. 
                Every brand under NIVPL carries forward the same passion for authenticity, consistency, and warmth that started it all.

                Driven by vision, rooted in values, and powered by people, NIVPL continues to shape

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            The story of NIVPL is deeply rooted in the vision of Mr. Soudagar and his sons,
            Mr. Niyaz Soudagar and Mr. Irshad Soudagar — a family driven by the belief that great
            food has the power to bring people together.
        </p>
        <p>
            What began as a simple idea in the heart of Belagavi’s old city soon grew into a
            defining movement in the region’s dining culture. At a time when eating out with family 
            and friends was not yet a norm, the Soudagars envisioned a space where people could share meals, 
            celebrate moments, and experience hospitality that felt personal.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that vision emerged a series of restaurants and concepts that combined dining, 
            takeaway, and home delivery, built around one unwavering principle the customer comes first. 
            Every decision, every recipe, 
            and every outlet was created with quality, consistency, and trust at its core.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>
           At NIVPL, our purpose has always been to make dining an experience worth sharing. 
           We wanted to redefine how Belagavi came together over food to create spaces where families gathered,
            friends reconnected, and celebrations found their flavour.
        <p>
            By nurturing a culture of hospitality that values people as much as food, 
            we’ve built more than just restaurants  we’ve built relationships that last.
        </p>

        <h2>Year of Establishment</h2>
        <p>
            The journey officially began on <strong>20th October 1989</strong>, The journey officially began on 20th October 1989, 
            a date that marked the birth of an idea destined to reshape Belagavi’s food culture. From a single restaurant to a thriving group of brands,
             NIVPL’s growth reflects decades of dedication, innovation, and a promise to serve only the best.
        </p>

        <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
